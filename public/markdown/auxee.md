## What is Auxee

Auxee is an AI-Powered secure, private, and cost-effective assistant designed for organizations. It helps teams dramatically increase research productivity by automating desk research, synthesizing data from multiple sources (internal databases, files, the web, and custom sources), analyzing for insights, and generating draft documents saving time and letting teams focus on strategic work.

### Key Capabilities / Use Cases

- **Synthesize knowledge streams** — integrate data from files, databases, the web, or custom sources into a unified workspace.
- **Analyze data and surface insights** — use AI to sift through data, create comparative tables & charts, uncover patterns and key insights.
- **Automated document drafting** — generate draft deliverables (e.g. reports, RFPs, compliance docs) based on historical data and context.
- **Real-time competitive intelligence & regulatory monitoring** — keep tabs on industry trends, competitor landscape or compliance requirements.
- **Collaborative knowledge building & sharing** — build queryable knowledge repositories; share articles, notes, search results internally for informed decision-making.

### My Role & Contributions

- Developed the frontend of Auxee using **Next.js + TypeScript + Material UI**.
- Fixed 100+ frontend bugs
- Built several features in dashboards
- Integrated with backend services and connected to **OpenAI APIs** for AI-powered features.

## What Makes It Stand Out

- Combines powerful AI capabilities with a clean and intuitive UI, making sophisticated knowledge management and data-analysis accessible to non-technical users.
- Supports a wide variety of data sources: from internal documents and databases to external web data, maximizing flexibility for organizations.
- Helps organizations streamline their workflow: from information gathering to insight generation and reporting, saving time and reducing manual overhead.
- Demonstrates full-stack development skills: integrating frontend UI with AI-driven backend, handling both user experience and data logic.
