# 👋 Hi, I’m Malik

I’m a frontend Engineer who builds fast, clean, and intuitive user interfaces.
Attention to detail is my thing. I believe the small code and design decisions are what transform a good interface into a memorable experience.

## 🌐 What I Do
- Build responsive, accessible, and production-ready UIs  
- Convert designs into scalable component systems  
- Write clean, predictable code using React + TypeScript  
- Bridge the gap between design and engineering

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vite  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Figma, REST APIs, Yarn

## 💼 How I Work
I’m straightforward, detail-focused, and committed to quality.  
If something can be clearer, faster, or more maintainable — I improve it.  
No shaky UI. No messy code.
